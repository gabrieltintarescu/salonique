# Open Graph Image

This is a placeholder for the Open Graph image. For production, you should create a 1200x630px image that represents your brand and place it at `/public/og-image.jpg`.

The image should include:
- Your logo/brand name "Salonique"
- A clear value proposition like "Gestionarea ProgramÄƒrilor pentru Saloane"
- Professional, clean design
- High contrast text for readability
- Brand colors that match your website

## Recommended specifications:
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 1200x630 pixels (Facebook/LinkedIn optimal)
- File size: Under 1MB
- Alt text: Should describe the image content

For now, the SEO setup will fall back to a default placeholder.
